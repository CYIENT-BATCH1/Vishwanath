Algorithm
Algorithm
-> read the array size
-> intialize array with given size
-> read array elements
-> call the function and pass the array
-> function definition 
    -> check two elements if both are in ascending(ex i and j ) 
    -> if true 
        -> increament j and call function again
    -> else
        -> swap elements and increament j
        -> and call function again
    -> repeat above steps untill j reaches to size-1 
-> repeat the above function definition until i reaches to size - 1
