/*Algorithm
1)read a value and assign it to num\
2)to extract odd bits do 0xAA logical & with num
3)to extract even bits do 0x55 logical with num
4)print the odd value
5)print the even value
6)and then right shift the odd value by 1 bit to get swapped even bits
7)and left shift the even value by 1 bit to get swapped odd bits
